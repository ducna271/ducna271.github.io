I am a research assistant at the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore (NUS), where I work with Prof [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). In July 2025, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics [Special Program in Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/ug/spm/) with a second major in Data Science, also from NUS.

My research interests lie in optimization, online learning, and applied probability, with applications to decision making under uncertainty, computational game theory, and reinforcement learning. All my previous works can be found on the [Publications](https://ducna271.github.io/publications/) page. 

I am deeply grateful to have received several research awards, including the [INFORMS Undergraduate Operations Research Prize 2024](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Undergraduate-Operations-Research-Prize), [NUS Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Prize 2023](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-prize/), Lijen Industrial Development Medal 2025 (for best NUS undergraduate math thesis), Operational Research Society of Singapore Prize 2025.
