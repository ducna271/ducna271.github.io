I am a research assistant at the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore (NUS), where I work with Prof. [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/) on nonconvex optimization with applications in machine learning and semidefinite programming. In July 2025, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics ([Special Program in Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/ug/spm/)) with a second major in Data Science, also from NUS.

My research interests lie in optimization, online learning, and applied probability, with applications to decision making under uncertainty, computational game theory, and reinforcement learning theory. In choronological order, I have worked on computational optimal transport with ML applications under Prof. [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), quantization and optimistic methods for distributed variational inequality under Prof. [Volkan Cevher](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/), stochastic difference-of-convex optimization under Prof. [Suvrit Sra](https://mcml.ai/research/groups/sra/) & Prof. [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/), and almost sure convergence of stochastic approximation under Prof. [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/). Currently, I am working on experimental design with local treatment under Prof. [David Simchi-Levi](https://slevi1.mit.edu/). My previous works can be found on the [Publications](https://ducna271.github.io/publications/) page.

I am deeply grateful to have received several research awards, including the [INFORMS Undergraduate Operations Research Prize 2024](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Undergraduate-Operations-Research-Prize), Lijen Industrial Development Medal 2025 (for best NUS undergraduate math thesis), [NUS Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Prize 2023](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-prize/), Operational Research Society of Singapore Prize 2025.
