I am a research assistant at the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore (NUS), where I work with Prof [Kim-Chuan Toh](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/). In July 2025, I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics with a second major in Data Science also from NUS.

My research interests lie in optimization, online learning, and applied probability, with applications to decision making under uncertainty, computational game theory, and reinforcement learning. I am extremely fortunate to recieve [INFORMS Undergraduate Operations Research Prize 2024](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Undergraduate-Operations-Research-Prize), [NUS Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Prize 2023](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-prize/), Lijen Industrial Development Medal 2025 (for best NUS undergraduate math thesis), Operational Research Society of Singapore Prize 2025.
